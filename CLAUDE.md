# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a newly initialized repository for "Norman Electrical" with minimal content. The repository currently contains:
- A logo file (`logo.png`)
- A comprehensive Visual Studio .gitignore file

## Technology Stack

Based on the .gitignore file, this appears to be set up for a .NET/Visual Studio project, though no actual code files exist yet.

## Repository State

This is a fresh repository with no established codebase, build configuration, or development workflows yet. Future development will likely involve:
- Setting up the initial .NET project structure
- Configuring build and development processes
- Establishing coding standards and practices

## Notes for Future Development

Since this is an empty repository, future Claude Code instances should:
- Help establish project structure when first code is added
- Assist with setting up appropriate build tools and configurations
- Follow .NET best practices when the technology stack is confirmed
